# Hi, I’m Peter Kane. 

I’m taking Electronic Textiles because I want to try something different before graduating. As an economics major, this is probably my last chance to explore a class that mixes tech and creativity in a hands-on way. I'm drawn to the opportunity of making projects that are both fun and functional. I’m here to experiment, mess around, and hopefully end up with something cool while learning skills I wouldn’t have gained by focusing only on software or hardware.


# Beyond My Elevator Pitch

I’m a two-year captain of the wrestling team here, and I keep a spreadsheet with my dad that tracks every match my brothers and I have ever wrestled. [My wrestling spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9dkCqh265QQ2rqxXeu3DNuI5r32dp8T/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112398599423921904595&rtpof=true&sd=true). I have two dogs, Toby (unknown brown dog) and Rez (Cattle Dog mix).

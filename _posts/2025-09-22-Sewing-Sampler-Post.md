Here's my sewing sampler.

If I could go back in time, I would have definitely bought an embroidery hoop. 
The satin stitch was particularly hard without consistent tension. I also would have looked at the 
rubric and done the thread-conserving satin stitch the first time, and learned a better way to finish my stitches.

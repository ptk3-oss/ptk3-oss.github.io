Hi, 

My name is Peter Kane. I'm a senior economics major. I've been hand-sewing, machine-sewing, quilting, and knitting since 6th grade. I've taken classes in python and java, but nothing like working with arduino or markdown. I did not do particularly well in either of them (pass failed). My boring fact is that I have 2 dogs.
